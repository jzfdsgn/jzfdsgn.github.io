<p>Over the weekend I played in a Store Treasure Cup with my boy Marco! I ran the animal package. I was having more success with it on the sim than the “classic” control build.</p><p>I ended up going x-1, losing in the last round to the winner. It was such a close game too. If I had played the last few turns a little differently, that we would be an X-0 up there.</p><p>Unfortunately I ended up 3rd, missing the better store credit prizing for 2nd. But overall I’m pretty happy with how I performed!</p><p><strong>Matchups</strong> r1 - ✅ RG Smoker <br>
r2 - ✅ Enel <br>
r3 - ✅ Rebecca <br>
r4 - ✅ Lucci <br>
r5 - ❌ Lucci <br>

The funny thing is I mainly played Marco for GP Luffy but didn’t pair into any of them. There were **4 Lucci’s** in total. And 3 of them were in the top 4!

Till next time,
GG’s</p>]]></content>
