<p>I got into 2 prerelease events for this set and just got back from the first one. And I did pretty well!</p><p>Undefeated, but the store only did 3 rounds which left 4 undefeated players. Top 4 got the winner card.</p><p>Picked up a box and pulled an SP Shirahoshi! Pretty happy with that pull even though I don’t plan on using it. I’m torn on trading or selling it though since it’s such a nice looking card!</p><p>Till the next one, GGs</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re going from one flavor of purple Luffy to another with <strong>OP11: A Fist of Divine Speed.</strong></p><p>Pre-release events are starting this week, and we’re already seeing people rip some cases! This set seems to be just as polarizing as EB02 since we already know a certain purple rubber man is going to dominate the meta. But we’re also getting the new starter decks, which the east didn’t have for their OP11 meta.</p><p>I’m excited for it. I think we have a lot of players who like to cook unique decks to try and combat the meta. Not only that, we have a regional in Vegas only a few weeks into the set. Which is too soon to call it a solved meta when you consider the starter decks.</p><p>Whether you’re excited or in the OP12 waiting room, it’s always fun ripping packs. So if you’re playing in a pre-release event, I recommend this guide from <a href="https://youtube.com/@artresstcg?si=vs7LBnidoVrVHdLX">Artress</a>. He puts one out for every set.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I played in a Store Treasure Cup with my boy Marco! I ran the animal package. I was having more success with it on the sim than the “classic” control build.</p><p>I ended up going x-1, losing in the last round to the winner. It was such a close game too. If I had played the last few turns a little differently, that we would be an X-0 up there.</p><p>Unfortunately I ended up 3rd, missing the better store credit prizing for 2nd. But overall I’m pretty happy with how I performed!</p><p><strong>Matchups</strong></p><p>r1 - ✅ RG Smoker <br>r2 - ✅ Enel <br>r3 - ✅ Rebecca <br>r4 - ✅ Lucci <br>r5 - ❌ Lucci</p><p>The funny thing is I mainly played Marco for GP Luffy but didn’t pair into any of them. There were <strong>4 Lucci’s</strong> in total. And 3 of them were in the top 4!</p><p>Till next time, <br>GG’s</p>]]></description>
